# RR_GearWeight_ByType_Slot
This Indie Game called Remote Realms developed by a single person, has a very intricate style of Armor/Gear System. This Application allows to calculate some stats using the in-game formulas without the need of having any in-game related items.

Plug and play, easy to use.

You become 2 Types by wearing different gears [Type1] | [Type2]:

you have to break the threshold of weight value 1.5 to break into the second type
normal type weight value has a special multiplier of 0.2 and metal has 0.5
Being Type 1 and Type 2 give you specific bonuses in-game.
Relevant but not really if you don't play the game, (picture included about how each type interacts with others in game).

----------
This still kind of work nowadays, but needs a v2 to be fully up-to-date.
Some added local database stuff added, but never used, still there because why not? If it's ever needed it's already in place.
